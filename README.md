- **Class:** T.E  
- **College Name:** Amrutvahini College of Engineering

## Project Description
The Weather Forecast Management System is a database-driven application built using PL/SQL. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage weather-related data for various locations. This project demonstrates the practical application of PL/SQL in managing complex data systems with real-world utility.

### Objectives
- To create a structured database for managing weather forecasts.
- To implement PL/SQL procedures and triggers for automated data handling.
- To provide an interface for querying weather information based on location and date.

## Features
1. **Table Structure:**
   - **Locations Table:**
     - Stores location details including city, state, and country.
     - Auto-generated primary key for unique identification.
   - **Weather_Data Table:**
     - Records weather forecasts linked to specific locations.
     - Includes fields for date, temperature, humidity, and more.
     - Foreign key relationship with the `Locations` table.

2. **Automated Data Management:**
   - Use of triggers for ensuring data consistency.
   - Procedures for inserting, updating, and deleting records.

3. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Optimized queries to fetch weather data by location and date.
   - Report generation for specific time periods or locations.

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** Oracle Database
- **Programming Language:** PL/SQL
- **Tools:** SQL*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer

## How to Use
1. Set up Oracle Database and configure PL/SQL tools like SQL*Plus or SQL Developer.
2. Execute the SQL script to create tables and relationships.
3. Populate the database with sample data using provided scripts.
4. Use provided PL/SQL procedures and triggers to manage data effectively.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with external weather APIs for real-time data.
- Development of a user-friendly front-end interface.
- Implementation of advanced analytics and visualization tools.
